										ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span className='font-bold text-primary'>Zeanur Rahaman Zeon</span>, a passionate full-stack
										developer from Bangladesh. My coding journey began during my first year at Northern University with
										C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms which built my problem-solving foundation.
									</>,
									<>
										In my second year, I got into web development to see how those concepts could be applied visually.
										Then I discovered the magic of turning ideas into interactive web applications. That's when I
										discovered the MERN stack â€” and I've been hooked ever since.

									<>
										I enjoy building things that feel useful. It feels great to make something that others can actually
										use.
									</>,
									<>
										I like working across both frontend and backend because it gives me full control of the product.
										Seeing an idea go from concept to reality is what keeps me motivated.

							<AboutInfoCard
								title='Beyond the Code'
								paragraphs={[
									<>
										When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me focusing on my academic studies and sometimes you
										might see me doing part time tuition. It keeps me balanced and helps me manage time better
									</>,
									<>
										In my free time, I enjoy music, games, anime, and chess â€” they help me relax and stay creative.
										These hobbies give me a break and often shape how I approach problems.
